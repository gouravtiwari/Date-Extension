Created date-extension to extend date class in Rails application (it can be used in any ruby application)

Look at 
		lib/core_extensions/date.rb</em>
		
It extends existing date class and provides couple of methods

		1) next_wednesday from current date 
		2) wednesday_of_week_in_year(week, year) for nth week in mth year
